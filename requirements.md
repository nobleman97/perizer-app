    cluster.

- **Set Up CI/CD with GitHub Actions:**
    Implement a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions that automates the build and deployment of your application to AKS, triggered by
    pushes to the main branch.

- **Documenting Your Journey:**
    Create a README: Document your project setup, architecture design, and deployment instructions in your repository's README.

- **Reflect on Your Experience:**
    Share your learning experience, focusing on the insights gained and challenges encountered.
